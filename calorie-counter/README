Project 4 Calorie Counter

For this week's project we divided and conquered tasks to complete while maintaining frequent communication
to update each other on work we completed and issues we ran into.
We made some custom images and icon launchers to add a bit of pizazz and uniqueness to our implementation.

The original idea for the UI was to create a gridlayout for the main portion of the homepage which included
the date, the labels, buttons, and labels that displayed the count.
There is also a version of a constraint layout as well that we thought would help with scaling and
UI cleanliness on rotation to landscape.

Building on what we learned on previous projects and in class activities we included functionality to
create a more seamless interaction. We included a new activity xml that the user gets to see when they
decide to update the count for any of the 3 things our app is keeping track of.

We also similar to the calculator project we included save and restore methods that would keep track
of the user's data while they went back and forth between interacting with the activity and leaving it.

The second activity has its own xml layout as well as code functionality within the MainActivity.kt
that does certain operations based on the user's choices
